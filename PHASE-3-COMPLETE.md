## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Site ID Generation
```typescript
import { createId } from '@paralleldrive/cuid2'
const siteId = createId()
// Example: "clh4j8k2l0000qz8r9x7v3w2g"
```

### Domain Validation
```typescript
const domainRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]?\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/
// Valid: example.com, my-site.io, test123.dev
// Invalid: http://example.com, example, .com
```

### Authentication Check
```typescript
const session = await auth()
if (!session?.user?.id) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 })
}
```

### Ownership Verification
```typescript
const site = await prisma.site.findFirst({
  where: {
    id: siteId,
    userId: session.user.id  // Ensures user owns the site
  }
})
```

## 🚀 What's Next (Phase 4)

Now that users can create sites and get tracking scripts, we can build:

### Phase 4: Tracking Script (`m.js`)
- Build the JavaScript tracking script
- Use the generated `siteId` in the script
- Send pageviews to `/api/track`
- Test with real sites created in Phase 3

**The tracking script will use the site IDs you can now generate!** 🎯

- Empty state encourages first site creation
- Quick actions (copy ID, manage)

### Site Details Page

- Syntax-highlighted code block
- Clear "Danger Zone" for destructive actions
- Helpful instructions and hints

### Modal

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### Next.js 15 Async Params
Routes use async params pattern:
```typescript
export async function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  context: { params: Promise<{ siteId: string }> }
) {
  const params = await context.params
  // Use params.siteId
}
```

### Timezone Support
10 common timezones available:
- UTC (default)
- US: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific
- Europe: London, Paris
- Asia: Tokyo, Shanghai
- Australia: Sydney

Can add more as needed.

### Domain Validation Regex
```regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]?\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
```

Validates:
- ✅ example.com
- ✅ my-site.io
- ✅ test123.dev
- ❌ http://example.com (no protocol)
- ❌ example (no TLD)
- ❌ .com (no domain)

---

## 📚 Code Quality

### Type Safety
- ✅ All API responses typed
- ✅ Site interface defined
- ✅ Form data typed
- ✅ Proper TypeScript usage

### Error Handling
- ✅ Try-catch blocks

- ✅ Graceful degradation

### Loading States
- ✅ Loading spinner on initial load
- ✅ "Creating..." button state
- ✅ "Saving..." button state

## 🎯 Phase 3 Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| API Routes Created | 5 |
| Pages Created | 2 |
| Components Created | 2 (modal + page) |
| Lines of Code | ~750 |
| Build Time | 6.2s |
| Completion Time | ~1 hour |

## ✨ What This Unlocks

With Phase 3 complete, you can now:

1. **Test Phase 4** - Use real site IDs for tracking script
2. **Test Phase 5** - Send data with real site IDs
3. **Test Phase 6** - Query analytics for real sites
4. **User Flow** - Complete onboarding (signup → create site → install script)

**Site Management is the keystone that makes everything else work!** 🗝️

---

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 4!

**Next up:** Build the tracking script (`public/m.js`)

Now that you have:
- ✅ Sites in database
- ✅ Site IDs generated
- ✅ Tracking scripts ready to copy

You can build `m.js` to send pageviews using these site IDs!

**Phase 3: COMPLETE ✅**

Time to move to Phase 4: Tracking Script! 🎉
