## 🧪 How to Test

# 1. Start server
make dev

# 2. Sign up with a NEW email (important!)
# - Use Google or GitHub OAuth
# - Must be email that hasn't signed up before

# 3. Check your inbox
# - Subject: "Welcome to Microlytics! 🎉"
# - Check spam folder if not in inbox

# 4. Verify in Resend dashboard
# https://resend.com/emails
```

### Test Multiple Times

```bash
# Gmail trick - all go to same inbox:
your-email+test1@gmail.com
your-email+test2@gmail.com
your-email+test3@gmail.com

# Or use temp email services:
# - temp-mail.org
# - guerrillamail.com
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Required
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxx"           # From resend.com

## 📈 Email Analytics

### Resend Dashboard

Track email performance:
- Delivery rate

- Click rate
- Bounce rate
- Spam complaints

**Access:** https://resend.com/emails

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sent

**Check server logs:**
```bash
# Success:
✅ Email sent: { to: 'user@example.com', subject: '...', id: '...' }

# Warning (no API key):
⚠️  RESEND_API_KEY not set. Email not sent: { to: '...', subject: '...' }

# Error:
❌ Email send error: [error details]
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env`
2. Check key is valid in Resend dashboard
3. Restart dev server: `make dev`
4. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

### Email in Spam

**This is normal for development!**
- Free tier uses shared IPs
- No domain authentication yet
- Always check spam during testing

**For production:**
1. Add your domain to Resend
2. Set up SPF/DKIM records
3. Warm up domain (gradual sending)

### Not Received at All

1. Wait 1-2 minutes (sometimes delayed)
2. Check spam folder
3. Verify in Resend dashboard
4. Try different email provider
5. Check if email address is valid
