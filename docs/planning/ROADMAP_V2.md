# Microlytics Roadmap v2 (Updated Build Order)

**Status:** Updated October 12, 2025
**Author:** Belteshazzar Marquez
**Scope:** Lean MVP for public launch (solo developer)

---

## Overview

This version corrects the development order based on system dependencies identified during analysis. The new order prioritizes completing the core vertical slice first:

> User creates site → installs tracking script → data is collected → analytics appear on dashboard.

This ensures an end-to-end working loop before expanding features.

## Development Details

### Phase 3 – Tracking Script ✅ Complete

**Status:** ✅ Complete (October 12, 2025)  
**Documentation:** `docs/phases/phase-4/PHASE-4-COMPLETE.md`

**Core Features:**
* Built `public/scripts/m.js` (<2KB gzipped)
* Collects: pathname, referrer, timestamp, browser, OS, device, screen size
* Generates visitor IDs (localStorage-based, privacy-first)
* Sends data via `navigator.sendBeacon()` to `/api/track`
* Gracefully handles errors (network failures, blocked requests)

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Script loads and executes without errors
- [x] Captures pageview on page load
- [x] Sends data to /api/track with site ID
- [x] Works in Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- [x] Works on mobile browsers
- [x] Handles network failures gracefully
- [x] Script size <2KB minified + gzipped
- [x] No console errors in browser
- [x] Privacy-first (no cookies, no personal data)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Static files at `/public/scripts/m.js` and `m.min.js`
- Uses `navigator.sendBeacon()` with `fetch()` fallback
- Visitor ID generated from random string + localStorage
- Test page: `/public/test/index.html`

### Phase 4 – Site Management ✅ Complete

**Status:** ✅ Complete (October 12, 2025)  
**Documentation:** `docs/phases/phase-4/PHASE-4-COMPLETE.md`

**Core Features:**
* `/dashboard/sites` page with site list
* Create site form (name, domain, timezone validation)
* Site details page with tracking script copy functionality
* Edit site (name, domain, timezone)
* Delete site (with confirmation, cascades to pageviews)

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] User can create site with name/domain/timezone
- [x] User sees generated site ID (`cuid2`)
- [x] User can copy tracking script snippet
- [x] User can view list of all their sites
- [x] User can edit site details
- [x] User can delete site (requires confirmation)
- [x] All operations show loading states
- [x] All operations handle errors gracefully
- [x] Form validation works (domain format, required fields)

**Technical Implementation:**
- API Routes: `POST /api/sites`, `GET /api/sites`, `PATCH /api/sites/[id]`, `DELETE /api/sites/[id]`
- Uses `cuid2` for collision-resistant site ID generation
- Domain validation (allows localhost for testing)
- Stores: siteId, name, domain, userId, timezone, createdAt

### Phase 5 – Data Ingestion API ✅ Complete

**Status:** ✅ Complete (October 12, 2025)  
**Documentation:** `docs/phases/phase-5/PHASE-5-COMPLETE.md`

**Core Features:**
* Production-ready `/api/track` POST endpoint
* Request validation (site ID exists, valid payload)
* User-Agent parsing for browser/device/OS info
* Pageview storage in PostgreSQL
* IP address masking (privacy-first)
* Rate limiting (100 req/sec)
* Site caching for performance

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Endpoint accepts POST requests
- [x] Validates site ID exists in database
- [x] Rejects invalid/malformed requests
- [x] Parses User-Agent correctly (uses `ua-parser-js`)
- [x] Stores pageview with all required fields
- [x] IP masking works (removes last octet/groups)
- [x] Returns 200 on success, 400/404 on errors
- [x] Logs detailed info in development mode
- [x] Responds in <100ms (40ms avg, 94ms P95)
- [x] Handles 100 requests/second (stress tested)

**Performance Results:**
- Average response: 40ms
- P95 latency: <100ms
- Error rate: 0%
- Sustained stability: 100 req/s for 30 seconds
- 10,827+ pageviews tracked successfully

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses `ua-parser-js` for User-Agent parsing
- IP-based rate limiting (1000 req/10 sec)
- Site caching (in-memory, reduces DB load)
- Asynchronous DB writes (fire-and-forget pattern)
- Connection pooling (20 connections, 20s timeout)

### Phase 6 – Dashboard Data Layer ✅ Complete

**Status:** ✅ Complete (October 12, 2025)  
**Documentation:** `docs/phases/phase-6/PHASE-6-COMPLETE.md`

**Core Features:**
* 4 analytics API endpoints with time range filtering
* Aggregation queries for pages, referrers, devices
* Dashboard UI connected to real data (all mock data replaced)
* Professional loading, error, and empty states
* Site selector for multi-site support
* Time range selector (7d/30d/90d)

**API Endpoints:**

- [x] Error states handle API failures
- [x] Empty states show when no data
- [x] Dashboard loads in <1 second (200-400ms observed)
- [x] Site ownership verification enforced
- [x] Multi-site support via dropdown selector

**Components Created:**
- `SiteSelector` - Multi-site dropdown
- `TimeRangeSelector` - 7d/30d/90d filtering

---

## MVP Launch Criteria

### Core Functionality (All Complete ✅)
- [x] User can create and manage sites
- [x] Tracking script records pageviews successfully
- [x] Data appears on dashboard in under 1 second
- [x] Privacy-compliant (no cookies, masked IPs)
- [x] Onboarding and emails function end-to-end
- [x] Multi-site support with site selector
- [x] Time range filtering (7d/30d/90d)
- [x] Real-time tracking (10,827+ pageviews tracked)

### Remaining for Launch
- [ ] Time-series charts for trends
- [ ] Real-time dashboard updates
- [ ] Export to CSV functionality
- [ ] Comprehensive automated test suite
- [ ] Production deployment to Vercel
- [ ] Performance optimization (Lighthouse 95+)
- [ ] Final QA and cross-browser testing

---

## Post-Launch Objectives

* Collect feedback via form on dashboard
* Monitor usage via Sentry/logs
* Plan billing integration (v2)
* Expand analytics visuals and filters

---

## Technical Decisions

### Site ID Format
**Decision:** Use `cuid2` library  
**Reason:** Short, URL-safe, collision-resistant, sortable by time  
**Implementation:** `import { createId } from '@paralleldrive/cuid2'`

### Rate Limiting
**Decision:** Skip for MVP, add in v1.1  
**Reason:** Premature optimization, Vercel has basic DDoS protection  
**Revisit:** When > 1000 sites or abuse detected

### Tracking Script Hosting
**Decision:** Static file at `/public/m.js`  
**Reason:** Simplest, CDN-cacheable, fast delivery  
**Upgrade Path:** Move to Edge Function if dynamic per-site config needed

### Time Zones
**Decision:** Store all timestamps in UTC, let users set display timezone preference  
**Reason:** Avoids conversion bugs, standard practice  
**Implementation:** Use `date-fns-tz` for display formatting

### User-Agent Parsing
**Decision:** Use `ua-parser-js` library  
**Reason:** Battle-tested, handles edge cases, actively maintained  
**Alternative:** Could build custom parser, but not worth the time

### Database Queries
**Decision:** Use Prisma `groupBy` for aggregations  
**Reason:** Type-safe, readable, good enough for MVP scale  
**Optimization:** Add raw SQL if performance becomes issue (>100k pageviews/day)

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Ad blockers block tracking script | High | 50% | Accept 30-50% data loss, document limitation, consider first-party domain |
| Prisma queries too slow | Medium | 30% | Add database indexes, monitor with Prisma Studio, optimize queries |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | 20% | Test on Safari/Firefox early, use polyfills, fallback to fetch |
| CORS errors from different domains | Low | 20% | Configure CORS properly, test with multiple domains early |
| Time zone calculation bugs | Medium | 40% | Store UTC only, let users choose display timezone, use tested library |
| Tracking script errors crash page | Low | 10% | Wrap in try-catch, fail silently, don't block page load |
| Database performance with large data | Medium | 30% | Add indexes on (siteId, timestamp), implement pagination |
| Users don't understand how to install | High | 40% | Clear documentation, onboarding checklist, video tutorial |
